PROJECT: BUILDING WITH BACKGROUNDS AND GRADIENTS

Microverse Fourth HTML and CSS Main Curriculum Project "Building With Backgrounds And Gradients".
In this project I will clone the website of one of the most design-forward companies in the world. Itâ€™s not a very complex site but it will use background photos well and the navbar at the top contains a gradient.
